= Rake-ist

Common rake tasks for a Rails project.

== Install

To install as a gem, add the following to config/environment.rb:

  config.gem 'rakeist'

Rake tasks are not automatically loaded from gems, so youâ€™ll need to add the following to your Rakefile:

  begin
    require 'rakeist/tasks'
  rescue LoadError
    STDERR.puts "Run `rake gems:install` to install rakeist"
  end

To install as a plugin:

  script/plugin install git://github.com/glennr/rakeist.git
    
== Usage

  rake setup        #Install gems and do db:setup
